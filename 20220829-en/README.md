# The comeback?

Today is a special day in my Australian journey! I did become an Aussie on 17/08/2022 but we didn't receive anything (more on that later if you're lucky) official, not even the citizenship certificate. So having collected my passport this morning made my day :)

Yes! The passport. I'm already at this stage. Time flies and life gets busy, as we all know. As you've probably noticed, I haven't been updating this blog regularly. Who knows if I'll get better at it but I'd like to acknowledge this particular milestone with this post.
